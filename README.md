# Dont touch the spikes remade in the Godot engine
 
## Aim of this project
This is a simple project I made in a few days using Godot. I had no particular aim in making this project however I hope that this will help someone understand Godot better.

## Contributing
Contributing or fixing my mistakes is absolutely welcomed, this project is not a full replica of the original game, it lacks many features and probably contains lots of bugs.

## Assets
All of the assets were made by me expect for the audio.

## Note
In order to test out the project you do not need to download it's source and run it in Godot. I provided exports for Windows and Android platforms in the Release tab.

Also the game is now available to play on the web here: https://m1zukash1.itch.io/dtts-remade-in-godot
